## Description

Here we have codes for the second phase of the Engineers League of the Pan African Robotics Competition which consisted in controlling a real robot in a real field to navigate through the plants and detect some specific plants during the navigation.

For more concrete information about the solution we gave to this task see [this readme document](./agribot/README.md).
