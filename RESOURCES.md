# Resources for the project
- [Getting Started Tutotial](https://parc-robotics.github.io/documentation-2023/getting-started-tutorials/setting-up-your-pc/)
- [ROS Tutorials](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials)
[YouTube Playlist: ROS Noetic For Beginners](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLSegLrePWgIbIrA4iehUQ-impvIXdd9Q)
- [Simultaneous Localization and Mapping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simultaneous_localization_and_mapping): This may or not be useful during this project. It is a mapping technique for unknown environments. I believe it would only be useful if we have the opportunity to learn the environment before using it. [This](https://www.mathworks.com/discovery/slam.html) is a Matlab article on the SLAM technique.
- [Obstacle Avoidance ROS](https://github.com/Rad-hi/Obstacle-Avoidance-ROS): Example of a ROS node that allows for a naive obstacle avoidance behavior based on laser scans from a Lidar (Gazebo simulation).
